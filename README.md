# Pokemon Quiz

This repository provides a simple command-line Pokemon personality quiz.

The quiz uses the original 151 Pokemon. It asks twenty short questions and
matches your answers to a Pokemon. Each Pokemon is uniquely reachable through
a combination of answers.

## Running the Quiz

Run the quiz using Python 3:

```bash
python quiz.py
```

Answer the questions by entering the number of the option you prefer. When
finished, the quiz will reveal which Pokemon best fits your personality.

The list of Pokemon is stored in `pokemon_data.py`, and the set of quiz
questions is defined separately in `questions.py`.
